# ASCII Art In The Access.log

Leave a present in someone's access.log!

To set up:

* git clone https://github.com/purple-goblin/access-ascii-art
* cd access-ascii-art
* Open `present.txt` and add your design
* Open `givepresent.py` and change the url
* `python givepresent.py`

Always give the design a border. Otherwise the spacing
will be ruined.
